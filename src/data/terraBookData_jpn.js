          caption: "Satoyama hills at dawn, the forest is unusually silent",
          story:
            "Yuki woke early near the Satoyama hills. The birds were silent. Maple and cedar looked tired, with thin leaves. Grandfather touched a cedar and said softly, “Too many trees have been cut.” The morning air felt warm and heavy."

          story:
            "Yuki once ran under tall cedars and maples, listening to leaves rustle and birds sing. Now, new roads and buildings replaced the green canopy. “Where will the birds go?” she asked. The quiet forest had no answer."

          story:
            "The rainy season changed. Some weeks were bone-dry; other times, storms flooded streets and rice fields. “The rain is no longer steady,” Mother sighed. Yuki watched the paddies fill and worried about the harvest."

          story:
            "By noon the sun felt sharp and relentless. The last shade barely cooled the air; even the river seemed warm. “The Earth is hotter,” Grandfather muttered. Yuki wished for helpful clouds."

          story:
            "“We can’t rely on the fields,” Father said. “We must move to Tokyo.” Yuki’s heart ached as they left the paddies, mountains, and quiet forest. Would she hear the birds again?"

          story:
            "Tokyo was bright and noisy—cars, trains, and endless streets. Skyscrapers and concrete covered the land. Yuki searched for a big tree but found only a few small ones. She missed the forest’s whisper."

          caption: "Why cities feel hotter: concrete, asphalt, and little shade",
          story:
            "Heat bounced off glass and stone. “Why is it so hot?” Yuki asked. “Concrete traps heat,” her uncle said. “Too few trees, too much cement—this is urban heat.” Yuki longed for green hills."

          story:
            "On a rooftop, a neighbor planted tomatoes, flowers, and a bonsai. “Plants make a difference,” she smiled. Yuki felt hope. Maybe green could return—even in Tokyo."

          story:
            "With her uncle, Yuki planted a small cherry tree near the building. Each morning she watered it. Each evening she whispered, “Grow strong. Give shade. Bring back the birds.” The tiny tree became her hope."

          story:
            "At sunset, the cherry leaves swayed. Yuki imagined Satoyama forests—the rustling leaves, birds calling, the forest breathing. She promised: “I will protect the trees. I will plant more. One day, Japan’s forests will whisper again.”"
