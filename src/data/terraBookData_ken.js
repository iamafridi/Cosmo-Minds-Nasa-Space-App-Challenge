          caption: "Mau Forest edge at sunrise, unusually quiet",
          story:
            "Amina woke early near the Mau Forest. The morning was quiet. The acacia outside looked weak—thin branches, falling leaves. Grandma touched its bark and whispered, “Too many trees have been cut.” The wind felt dry and hotter than before."

          caption: "Stumps where tall acacia and cedar once stood",
          story:
            "Amina remembered shade and monkey calls under acacia and cedar. Now, machines had taken trees for timber and farms. Bare hills replaced the canopy. “Where will the animals go?” she asked. Grandma stayed silent."

          caption: "Too dry… then sudden floods",
          story:
            "The rains no longer came as they should. Some months, no rain—cracked earth, shrinking rivers. Then, heavy storms flooded fields and washed away huts. “The seasons are broken,” Father said. Amina wondered if the land could heal."

          caption: "Empty waterholes and dusty wind",
          story:
            "By midday the air felt like fire. Few trees gave little shade. Cows crowded empty waterholes; goats wandered far. “The land is sick,” Grandma murmured. Amina searched the horizon for a single cloud."
        },

          caption: "Leaving the forest edge for Nairobi",
          story:
            "“The crops are failing. We must go to Nairobi,” Father said. Amina looked one last time at the forest edge and dry riverbed. Would she ever hear hornbills again?"
        },

          caption: "Matatus, tall buildings, and little shade",
          story:
            "Nairobi was crowded and loud. Matatus honked; towers rose into the sky. Smoke filled the air. Trees were few, replaced by cement and roads. Amina missed the Mau Forest’s cool green."
        },

          year: "Page 7 — The Heat of Nairobi",
          image: "/images/ken_page7_heat_nairobi.jpg",
          caption: "Urban heat explained",
          story:
            "The pavement burned; walls trapped the sun’s fire. “Why so hot?” Amina asked. “Too much concrete, not enough trees,” her uncle said. “This is urban heat. Nairobi is forgetting its green heart.” Amina wiped her face and stayed quiet."

          caption: "Rooftop pots with sukuma wiki and beans",
          story:
            "On the roof, a neighbor planted sukuma wiki, beans, and a small mango in pots. “Plants cool our homes,” she smiled. Amina’s eyes widened. Even in the city, green could return."

          caption: "A young moringa by the building",
          story:
            "With her uncle’s help, Amina planted a moringa near their building. Each morning she brought water. Each evening she whispered, “Grow strong. Bring back shade. Remind me of home.” The little tree became her hope."

          caption: "“One day, Kenya’s forests will whisper again.”",
          story:
            "At sunset, Amina stood by her moringa. Its tiny leaves moved in the breeze. She imagined the Mau—birds calling, trees rustling, wind whispering. Hand on the stem, she promised: “I will protect you. I will plant more. One day, Kenya’s forests will whisper again.”"
