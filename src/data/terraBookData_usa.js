          caption: "California forest at dawn, strangely silent",
          story:
            "Lila woke near California’s forests. Birds were quiet. Pines looked tired, needles thin and brown. Grandfather touched the bark: “Too many trees are gone.” Even the morning breeze felt hot and dry."

          story:
            "She remembered cool shade under redwoods and firs. Now, big areas were empty from logging and wildfires. “Where will the animals go?” Lila asked. Only the wind answered through broken branches."

          story:
            "Rains no longer came the old way. Some winters were dry and rivers shrank; other times, storms brought floods that washed out roads and fields. “The weather isn’t what it used to be,” Mum said."

          story:
            "By noon, the air felt like fire. Even under trees it was hot. The creek was low. “The Earth is burning,” Grandfather said. Lila looked up—clouds hid behind wildfire smoke."

          story:
            "“We can’t live safely here. We must go to Los Angeles,” Father said. Lila took one last look at needles, streams, and animal tracks. Would she ever hear the birds again?"

          story:
            "Los Angeles was loud and crowded. Buses roared, cars honked, buildings rose high. Only a few trees struggled between sidewalks. Lila missed the forest’s deep green."

          caption: "Urban heat explained",
          story:
            "The city felt hotter than the forest. Roads, walls, and air trapped heat. “Why so hot?” Lila asked. “Urban heat,” Uncle said. “Too much concrete, too few trees.”"

          story:
            "On the roof, a neighbor planted tomatoes, sunflowers, and a small maple in pots. “Plants cool buildings,” she smiled. “Even small trees help.” Lila felt hope return."

          story:
            "With Uncle’s help, Lila planted a young pine near their building. Each day she watered it and whispered, “Grow tall. Give shade. Bring back the animals.” The little tree became her friend."

          story:
            "At sunset, Lila stood by her tiny pine. Its needles swayed in the breeze. She imagined the forest—birds, rustling trees, nature’s whisper. Hand on the stem, she promised: “I’ll protect you. I’ll plant more. One day, the forests will whisper again.”"
