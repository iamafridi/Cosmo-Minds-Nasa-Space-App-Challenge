          caption: "Ratanpur at dawn — quiet koel, tired mango tree",
          story:
            "Ritu woke before sunrise. The koel was quiet. The mango tree outside looked sick—thin branches, few leaves. Grandfather touched the bark and whispered, “They cut too many trees.” The air felt hot and dry, even before the sun rose."

          caption: "Jackfruit and banyan stumps where forest once stood",
          story:
            "Ritu remembered running under jackfruit and banyan trees with her cousins while parrots and bulbuls sang. Now many trees were gone. Empty stumps stood in silence. “Where will the birds go now?” she asked. No one answered."

          caption: "Monsoon late, then sudden floods over rice fields",
          story:
            "The monsoon came late. When rain finally arrived, it was too much, too fast. Ponds overflowed and fields flooded. Rice seedlings washed away. “Rain has changed,” Mother sighed. “Sometimes none, sometimes too much.” Ritu wondered how they would eat."

          caption: "Midday like burning coal; thin shade gives no relief",
          story:
            "By midday the air felt like burning coal. The mango’s thin shade no longer cooled. Her brother fanned himself with cardboard. Grandfather wiped his forehead with a gamcha. “The Earth is burning,” he muttered. The sky stayed empty and blue."

          caption: "Leaving the village for Dhaka",
          story:
            "Father said, “We cannot grow enough food anymore. We must move to Dhaka.” Ritu looked at the fields, the river, and the few trees left. As they boarded the bus, she turned back. Would she ever hear the koel’s call again?"

          story:
            "Dhaka was crowded and loud. Horns, buses, wires across the sky. Everywhere was concrete—buildings, walls, roads. Ritu searched for trees but found only a few, small and dusty by the roadside. She missed the cool forest and the birds."

          caption: "Urban heat trapped by roads and walls",
          story:
            "The city heat felt worse. It rose from roads and walls. “Why is it hotter here?” Ritu asked. “Urban heat,” said her uncle. “Too much concrete, too many cars, not enough trees.” Ritu wiped sweat and wondered if the city could ever feel cool."

          story:
            "On the rooftop, Ritu saw a neighbor planting pots—spinach, flowers, even a small papaya tree. “Plants cool the house,” the woman smiled. “Even small ones help.” For the first time since leaving Ratanpur, Ritu felt a spark of hope."

          story:
            "With her uncle’s help, Ritu planted a small neem near their house. Every morning she carried water. Every evening she whispered, “Grow strong. Give us shade. Bring back the birds.” The little tree became her friend."

          story:
            "At sunset, the neem’s tiny leaves swayed in the wind. Ritu closed her eyes and heard the old forest—rustling leaves and the koel’s song. She placed her hand on the stem and promised, “I will protect you. I will plant more. One day, the whispers will return.”"
